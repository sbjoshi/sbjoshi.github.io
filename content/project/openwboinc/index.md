## Open-WBO-Inc

Open-WBO-Inc is an open-source incomplete solver for MaxSAT. Often, real-world applications demand a _good_ answer to MaxSAT optimization problem very quickly. Incomplete solvers strive to find a _good_ answer very fast but may not guarantee _optimality_ of the provided answer.

Open-WBO-Inc has won several accolades at international arena. In addition, it serves as a platform on top of which other award winning solvers such as [Loandra](https://github.com/jezberg/loandra) and TT-Open-WBO-Inc has been built.
